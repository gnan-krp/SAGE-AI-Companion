# SAGE – Smart Autonomous Guidance Engine

SAGE is a simulation-based AI companion system designed to demonstrate core concepts of intelligent systems, including perception, interaction, emotion modeling, and behavior-driven decision making.

This project is built as a **software-first companion agent**, inspired by modern desktop and robotic assistants, focusing on AI logic rather than physical hardware.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 🎥 **Computer Vision**: Face detection using OpenCV  
- 🎙️ **Voice Interaction**: Speech input and output  
- 🧠 **Emotion Engine**: Internal emotional states (idle, happy, bored)  
- 🤖 **Autonomous Behavior**: Rule-based decision making  
- 🧩 **Modular Design**: Clean and scalable Python architecture  

---

## 🧠 Motivation

The goal of SAGE is to understand how intelligent agents:
- Perceive their environment
- Interact with users
- Maintain internal states
- Respond autonomously based on inputs

The project is developed in a **simulation environment**, allowing easy extension to real robotic hardware in the future.
