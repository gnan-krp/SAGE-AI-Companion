# SAGE – Emotion-Driven AI System 🤖🧠

SAGE (Sentient Adaptive Generative Entity) is a beginner-level AI system designed to **simulate emotional behavior and decision-making** in response to user interactions.

Unlike typical AI demos that only focus on outputs, SAGE focuses on **how an AI decides what to do**.

---

## 📌 Why this project?

Most early AI projects:
- Take input
- Produce output
- Do not explain *why* a response was chosen

This project explores:
- How emotions can influence AI behavior
- How rules can model basic intelligence
- How decision-making works before machine learning is introduced

This project is **concept-first, not code-heavy**.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

SAGE maintains an **internal emotional state** and updates it based on events such as:
- User interaction
- Emotional input
- Commands (sing, mimic, respond)

The AI then **chooses actions based on its emotional state**.

Each step is intentionally separated to mirror **real AI system design**.

## 😊 Emotion States

SAGE supports basic emotional states:

| Emotion | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| Idle | Calm / smiling |
| Excited | User interaction detected |
| Happy | Positive emotional input |
| Sad | Negative emotional input |
| Bored | No interaction |

These emotions **directly influence responses**.

---

## 🔄 Emotion Transition Logic

Idle
├── user interacts → Excited
├── no interaction → Bored
├── positive emotion → Happy
└── negative emotion → Sad


This rule-based approach helps understand **how AI behavior can be controlled**.

---

## 🎯 Example Scenarios

### 1️⃣ User greets SAGE
- Emotion: Idle → Excited
- Response: Friendly greeting

### 2️⃣ User shares something sad
- Emotion: Idle → Sad
- Response: Empathetic message

### 3️⃣ User gives a command
- Emotion: Excited
- Action: Sing / mimic animal sound

---

## 🧪 Current Version (v1)

- Text-based input
- Rule-based emotion handling
- No machine learning
- No memory across sessions

This version focuses on **clarity over complexity**.

---

## 🚧 Limitations

- Emotions are predefined, not learned
- No real understanding of language
- Responses are rule-based
- No long-term memory

These limitations are intentional for learning purposes.

---

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

### 🔹 v2 (Next)
- Sentiment analysis using NLP
- Emotion intensity (not just labels)
- Simple memory of last interaction

### 🔹 v3 (Advanced)
- Voice input
- Sound output
- Optional robotic embodiment
